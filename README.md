# Audio Signal Classification (similar to image classifier)

## Practice expercise
#1. Before starting audio signal classification, first understand the audio data type. Start your prctice by first manipulating an audio file with librosa, aubio and python.

### Audio data manipulation:
Use <b>audio-manipulation-with-python.ipynb</b> for audio signal manipulation and plot audio pitches.
Input audio file: <b>sample.wav</b>
output audio file: <b>robot_embedded_output.wav</b>
Run the jupyter notebook file and pass input and output file name. The code will retun a robot voice embedded output file to the human input voice file.
